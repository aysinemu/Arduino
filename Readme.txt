## Introduction

Arduino Mini Project.

You will need all the component like below if you don't have that component just replace with a different component but make sure that component work the same.

Component: in every Arduino project there is a component.txt it's will list out everything you need to make that project.

## Wire

You can connect sensor and motor into any pin of Arduino and Motor Shield but make sure you note it down so later you need to change the pin number in the <Project>.ino code.

## Test

After done connecting the wire you need to test all the sensor and the motor to see if it's working smoothly or not.

## Finally

After done testing and change the pin number and if everything working according to plan then upload the project code to your Arduino and have fun.
