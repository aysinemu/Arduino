Remember to re-declare the sensor and motor pins, everyone.
Note that each bool code segment means it moves straight, and at some point, it turns.
The time for moving straight and turning depends on the formula v=s/t.
Adjust the timing so that the car runs correctly.
Be sure to use a Li-ion battery so that the car can run longer, as this code relies heavily on timing, and weak batteries will significantly affect the timing.

This code help you can easy finish any map by just adjust the timer.
